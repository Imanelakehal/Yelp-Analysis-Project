What Is Yelp?
Founded in 2004, Yelp is a popular online directory for discovering local businesses ranging from bars, restaurants, and cafes to hairdressers, spas, and gas stations.

How Does Yelp Work?
You can search Yelp via its website or with the official apps on iOS and Android smart devices. Listings are sorted by business type and results are filtered by geographical location, price range, and unique features like outdoor seating, delivery service, or the ability to accept reservations.

Yelp has a strong social aspect and encourages its users to leave written reviews, star ratings, and photos of their experience with each business they visit.

Each Yelp account has a friends list that can be populated by connecting the app with Facebook and a smartphone or tablet's address book. Reviews posted on Yelp can also be reviewed by other users, while popular reviewers have the potential to be promoted to Yelp Elite status.

Yelp Dataset
The Yelp dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data that has been made publicly available for use for personal, educational, and academic purposes. Available as JSON files, use it to teach students about databases, to learn NLP, or for sample production data while you learn how to make mobile apps. This dataset contains 6,685,900 reviews, 192,609 businesses, 200,000 pictures in 10 metropolitan areas.
